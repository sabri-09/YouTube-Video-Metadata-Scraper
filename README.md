## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger:** The user provides a list of YouTube URLs, channel names, or search queries via the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic:** Appilot uses UI Automator or Selenium to navigate to each video, extract metadata (title, description, tags), and save it locally.  
3. **Output or Action:** Collected data is structured and stored as JSON or CSV files, ready for analytics or import into keyword tools.  
4. **Other Functionalities:** Retry logic, logging, deduplication, and scheduled runs ensure consistent, reliable operation.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python, Java, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Selenium, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues
